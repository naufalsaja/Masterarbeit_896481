The behavior and interaction of the main components of Ship Propulsion Systems cannot be easily modeled with a priori physical knowledge, considering the large amount of variables influencing them.  Data-Driven Models (DDMs), instead, exploit advanced statistical techniques to build models directly on the large amount of historical data collected by the modern on-board automation systems, without requiring any a priori knowledge. DDMs are extremely useful when it comes to continuously monitor the propulsion equipments to avoid Preventive or Corrective Maintenance and take decisions based on the actual condition of the propulsion plant. Unfortunately, DDMs need a large amount of data to achieve satisfying performances. While sensor data are cheap and easy to collect, label them with the actual state of decay of a component can be quite expensive and in some cases unfeasible.
In this paper, the authors investigate the problem of performing Condition-Based Maintenance though the use of DDMs. First, state-of-the-art supervised learning techniques are adopted, which require a large amount of labeled sensor data in order to be deployed. Then, an unsupervised learning approach is developed as it allows to minimize the feedback of the operators in labeling the sensor data.
A Navy vessel, characterised by a combined diesel-electric and gas propulsion plant, has been exploited to show the effectiveness of the proposed approaches. Confidentiality constraints with Navy force us to use a real-data validated simulator and the dataset has been published for free use through the UCI repository.
